# Description
It's all started when i executed the script that my friend sent to me can you retrieve the flag that was stolen?
[File](./Arson.pcapng)
# Solution 
download the file
open it with wireshark
he said that his friend sent a script to him. so it'll probably be in export objects. we export the .ps1 file and examine it
you can learn about the code [here](https://pastebin.com/aZAm4bd2)
after examinning it we can create a decryptor from the existing code and use to decrypt our flag
# Flag
flag{2C_p0w3r_Chi11}
